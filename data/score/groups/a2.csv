19	20	Dog control laws to be reviewed in government consultation	a	1	2	2
20	21	Dog control laws in Scotland are being reviewed amid concerns about out-of-control animals and irresponsible owners.	a	2	1	2
21	22	A consultation has been launched by the Scottish Government seeking the public's views.	a	1	2	2
22	23	"Scotland's Community Safety Minister pledged to ""keep communities safe from irresponsible owners,"" with reviews to determine whether laws for out-of-control dogs need changing."	a	1	1	1
23	24	"Ash Denham MSP said: ""We are holding two reviews into dog control legislation because we are absolutely determined to help keep communities safe from irresponsible owners and their out-of-control dogs."	a	1	2	2
24	25	This consultation seeks views on improvements on how the Control of Dogs Act 2010 can operate across Scotland, and next year we will take a wider look at all dog control legislation to assess whether changes are needed.	a	1	1	2
25	26	"Owning a dog brings with it certain responsibilities, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage everyone with an interest in this area to respond to our consultation."""	a	1	1	1
26	27	The consultation runs until January 15 and contains proposals to toughen and clarify the current legislation, including questioning whether a national dog control database should be created.	a	1	2	2
27	28	The Scottish Parliament's Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee has been hearing evidence from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs, prompting the Government to review dog control laws.	a	1	3	2
28	29	MSPs were told the legislation needs urgent reform to protect vulnerable people and children.	a	1	3	2
29	30	The committee heard that, in Greater Glasgow and Clyde alone, there were 1,417 people arriving at A&E departments with dog-related injuries, 255 of them children, last year.	a	1	2	3
30	31	NHS Lanarkshire treated 912 people and NHS Ayrshire 439, both four-year highs.	a	1	2	3
31	32	In July, the committee's MSPs concluded current dog control legislation is not fit for purpose and called on the Scottish Government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog-control laws.	a	1	2	2
32	33	"Convener Jenny Marra said: ""Dog law in Scotland is not fit for purpose."	a	1	2	2
33	34	There are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks.”	a	1	2	2
34	35	It has become clear that current dog control law doesn't work. 	a	1	2	1
35	36	It needs reform urgently so that out of control and dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly and we can try to move to a system that prevents our children being injured by dogs.	a	1	2	2
36	37	"The consultation, launched on the Government's website on Friday, says: ""Effective and consistent enforcement across Scotland is fundamental in helping address issues relating to out-of-control dogs.”"	a	1	1	1
37	38	This review is focused on steps that can be taken to help aid enforcement agencies such as local authorities, as they use their powers to help keep communities safe.	a	2	2	1

40	54	The 35-year-old star dumped the NBA player for good earlier this year after he was accused of cheating on her with family friend Jordyn Woods - having previously cheated when she was nine months pregnant with their daughter, True.	b	1	3	2
41	55	Tristan was spotted leaving another gushing compliment on Khloe's Instagram page	b	1	2	2

43	57	"In the blurred snap, Khloe is stood in front of the rising sun, with the mum-of-one captioning the pic: ""May you have the courage to explore every dream you dream."""	b	1	2	2
44	58	"Publicly commenting, Tristan wrote: ""The sun is shining bright on a beautiful [diamond emoji]."""	b	1	2	3
45	59	"Fans were outraged by the remark, with one replying: ""Yeah, a diamond that you DROPPED."""	b	2	3	1
46	60	Tristan cheated on Khloe when she was nine months pregnant	b	1	3	2
47	61	"Another advised: ""Just get off Instagram."""	b	1	2	2
48	62	"A third wrote: ""Don't fall for it Khloe."""	b	1	3	2
49	63	"It comes just days after Tristan wrote: ""Perfection"" alongside the heart eye emojis underneath one of the reality stars other photos, which saw her modelling for Guess Jeans."	b	1	2	2
50	64	Earlier this month, The Sun revealed that Tristan bought Khloe a £400,000 Porsche in a bid to win her back - on the advice of Drake.	b	1	2	2
51	65	He was then accused of cheating again earlier this year - with Kardashian family friend Jordyn Woods	b	1	2	2
52	66	"He settled on the grovelling gift, thought to be a 911, after being urged to pull a ""power move"" by his rapper pal."	b	1	2	3
53	67	As a result, pals said Tristan even won an invite from Khloe to a 'Taco Tuesday' dinner at her mansion - bringing him one step closer to a reunion with the reality star and their 17-month-old daughter True.	b	1	1	1
54	68	"A source said: ""Tristan is good pals with Drake and has been using him as a sounding board as he plots his return to the Kardashian fold."	b	1	2	2
55	69	Khloe was left heartbroken by Tristan's infidelity	b	1	2	1
56	70	Drake told him to pull out all the stops if he wanted to win Khloe back.	b	1	2	1
57	71	An invite to a casual dinner might not sound like a reasonable trade off for a sleek supercar.	b	1	2	3
58	72	But after what Tristan did, he can't expect Khloe to roll out the red carpet for him.	b	1	3	2
59	73	The pair are mum and dad to 17-month-old True	b	1	1	2

65	39	HSBC flips crime-spotting tool to scope new business	a	1	3	2
66	40	British bank HSBC (HSBA.L) has converted a financial crime-spotting algorithm it was forced to build in the wake of a money-laundering scandal into one that can scope out new business opportunities, bank executives said.	a	1	2	3
67	41	The system combines data on clients’ banking activities, with public data on company ownership and directorships, to flag desirable potential clients to HSBC staff and offer ways to connect to them through existing relationships.	a	2	1	1
68	42	Using data and artificial intelligence to try and boost revenues is part of HSBC's broader push to squeeze more out of its large physical network and client data, a key priority for interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn.	a	1	1	1
69	43	It's one of the first commercial uses of investment in financial crime prevention, and the business we're getting in this way is inherently lower risk and quicker to win, said Stuart Nivison, HSBC's global head of client network banking.	a	1	2	1
70	44	"HSBC declined to comment on how much it expects to make from the new system but said the broader ""network income"" initiative has already yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue."	a	1	1	2
71	45	The drive is an important part of the bank's efforts to defend its global presence at a time when some analysts and investors are saying it should shrink or exit markets like the United States where it makes returns below its cost of capital.	a	1	2	1
72	46	HSBC was forced to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in financial crime compliance as part of a $1.9 billion settlement in 2012 with U.S. authorities over the bank's failure to prevent money laundering by drug cartels through its Mexican unit.	a	2	1	1
73	47	The system works by mapping individual customers and companies ties to each other and then looking for unusual patterns of transactions or unearthing previously unknown connections between those entities.	a	1	2	1
74	48	That system has already freed up more than 400 staff to go from manually checking transactions and records to client-facing roles where they can spend time helping customers, said Adrian Rigby, chief operating officer of HSBC's trade business.	a	1	2	3
75	49	"HSBC's Nivison said the lightbulb moment was realizing the tool could be repurposed to look for ""green flags"" of attractive potential clients rather than ""red flags"" of wrongdoing."	a	1	3	2
76	50	We took our customer dataset and combined it with (Britain's) Companies House data and turned the algorithm around to look for attractiveness in a client, whether that be through sector, growth of the company, and connection to existing clients, Nivison said.	a	1	2	2
77	51	The tool has mapped 22.5 million entities and people in Britain, and can identify in three minutes a network of connections that a staff member would have taken three hours to map out manually, he said.	a	1	2	3
78	78	Adorable pictures show new-born rhino nuzzling her mother and exploring new home	b	2	2	1
79	79	Baby Stella was welcomed into the world at Cotswold Wildlife Park, Oxfordshire, earlier this month and is the first female born to parents Monty and Ruby.	b	1	3	2
80	80	The youngster, who is healthy and nursing well, can be seen wondering about her enclosure before resting alongside her mother on a bed of straw.	b	1	2	3
81	81	Mother Ruby joined the wildlife park in 2009 alongside another female called Nancy in the hope that one would produce the park's first ever calf with Monty.	b	1	2	3
82	82	Nancy then gave birth to a female named Astrid in 2013, with Stella being the third female calf born at the park in its 49-year history.	b	1	3	2
83	83	Jamie Craig, curator of Cotswold Wildlife Park, said: 'We have had tremendous success with our current rhino herd.	b	1	2	3
84	84	Stella is the sixth youngster from Nancy and Ruby and our bull, Monty, has proved to be an excellent dad.	b	1	3	2
85	85	'He is the perfect combination of a dominant bull and caring patriarch.	b	1	2	3
86	86	It is particularly satisfying that Ruby has produced a female calf - these are vital for the development of the breeding programme and Stella will eventually move to another collection to hopefully become a successful mother herself.'	b	1	2	2
87	87	Ruby has had two boys before, Ian in 2015 and Alan in 2017.	b	1	2	2
88	88	Alan is still at the park whilst Ian is in Torino Zoo in Italy	b	1	2	2
89	89	When Alan was just one-week old he weighed around eleven stone.	b	1	2	1
90	90	Births in captivity are considered extremely rare.	b	1	2	2
91	91	Females only reproduce every two-and-a-half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.	b	1	2	1
92	92	According to the park, a typical gestation period lasts between sixteen to eighteen months, after which a single calf is born.	b	1	3	2
93	93	It is considered the longest gestation periods of any land mammal, surpassed only by the twenty-two month gestation period of an Elephant.	b	1	2	2
94	94	A newborn Rhino calf will stand up within one hour of birth.	b	1	3	2
95	95	Once born, the calf will immediately attempt to suckle, although he or she may be a little unsteady on their feet for the first few days.	b	1	3	2
96	96	It will remain under the watchful eye of the mother, suckling from her for approximately one year.	b	1	3	2
97	97	Their bond is an intensely strong one and the calf will remain with its mother for at least two years, benefiting from her protection.	b	1	3	2
98	98	Females guard their offspring aggressively and are intimidating adversaries if challenged.	b	1	3	2
