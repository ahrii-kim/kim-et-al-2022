0	381	Cleveland police branded 'failing' in all areas by inspectors	b	1	2	2
1	382	"Scandal-hit Cleveland police has become the first force to be branded ""failing"" in all areas by inspectors."	b	2	3	1
2	383	It has been rated inadequate overall and in three key areas by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS), which scrutinised its ability to reduce crime and keep people safe, operate efficiently, as well as the way it treats the public and its workforce.	b	1	2	3
3	384	"The findings mean the force is effectively plunged into special measures, where the chief constable and police and crime commissioner are called before a national board and questioned about their plans to ensure ""critical improvements"" are made."	b	1	3	2
4	385	The home secretary could then step in to tackle the problem if no progress is made.	b	1	1	2
5	386	A string of scandals has plagued the force, covering Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough in the north east of England.	b	1	3	2
6	387	It has seen six chief constables in almost as many years.	b	1	3	2
7	388	"Former chief constable Sean Price was sacked for gross misconduct in 2012; seven officers were under investigation after journalists"" phones were unlawfully monitored, and there have been long-standing claims of racism within the ranks."	b	1	2	3
8	389	"Work practices were recently described by the chief inspector of constabulary as being about as ""inefficient as you can possibly imagine,"" with officers having to share laptops and bodyworn cameras."	b	1	2	2
9	390	"HM Inspector of Constabulary Phil Gormley said it was a ""failing force"" where there had been ""significant"" deterioration in the last two years."	b	1	2	3
10	391	"Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said the report described the ""worst findings ever into any police force in the country"" which was ""finally the official validation"" that the force is ""broken"" and said the Home Office needed to intervene now."	b	1	2	3
11	392	"He added: ""It's no longer in dispute."	b	2	3	1
12	393	It is a fact described in black and white in this report.	b	1	2	2
13	394	The findings are some of the most distressing and shocking I have ever read.	b	2	1	2
14	395	Cleveland is one of 15 forces that has been recently inspected by HMICFRS inspectors, and the only one rated inadequate in all areas.	b	1	2	2
15	396	"Gormley added: ""The force doesn't appropriately prioritise crime prevention."	b	1	2	3
16	397	There is a lack of strategic direction, and the force doesn't allocate enough resources to prevention work …	b	1	3	2
17	398	It is failing to respond appropriately to vulnerable people, including children.	b	2	1	2
18	399	"It is missing opportunities to safeguard them and exposing them to risk."""	b	1	3	2
19	400	"He said senior leaders were not consistently demonstrating ""ethical behaviour,"" and the ""inappropriate behaviour of senior leaders within Cleveland is so profound that it is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force."""	b	1	2	3
20	401	"He added: ""It doesn't consistently treat its workforce with fairness and respect and it doesn't effectively communicate with or engage its workforce; its processes aren't perceived to be fair and it doesn't understand its workforce well enough to support them."""	b	1	3	2
21	402	Despite the findings, the force did receive a small amount of praise for the way it tackles serious and organised crime but was told it must improve the way it investigates crimes.	b	2	1	1
22	403	"The force's police and crime commissioner Barry Coppinger said: ""I am deeply concerned at the worrying contents of this report."	b	1	1	2
23	404	The force's recent performance is simply not good enough.	b	1	2	3
24	405	"He said he had received assurances from the current chief constable Richard Lewis that ""swift action"" was taken as soon as he became aware of the failings."	b	1	3	2
25	406	Coppinger has been ordered by the Home Office to respond to the report within 56 days.	b	1	1	2
26	407	"Lewis said the report would act ""as a line in the sand"" for the force, adding: ""Improvements have already been made and I take full responsibility for driving through the changes that are so obviously needed."	b	1	3	2
27	408	"In the five months I've been here I have met some exceptional police officers and staff, at all levels, and have seen lives saved and vulnerable people protected by the efforts and determination of frontline officers."""	b	1	2	3
28	409	If drastic improvements are not made quickly enough, the Government could step in, as it can when prisons are failing.	b	2	1	3
29	410	But so far politicians have never had to resort to this measure with police forces, inspectors said.	b	1	2	2
30	411	"Kit Malthouse, minister for crime, policing and fire, said he welcomed the chief constable's ""swift action to address these failings and will be monitoring the position closely,"" adding: ""Transparency and accountability are vital for public trust in policing."	b	1	2	3
31	138	David Attenborough working on new documentary about animals and colour	a	1	2	1
32	139	David Attenborough is 93-years-old but the iconic nature guru is not slowing down just yet.	a	1	3	2
33	140	No, after the success of his groundbreaking Netflix documentary Our Planet, the much loved star is set to return with another series: Life In Colour.	a	1	2	3
34	141	This time, the father-of-two will look at how animals use colour in their lives through high-tech cameras that were built especially for the programme.	a	1	2	1
35	142	"The BBC have revealed that the star aims to show ""a world of colour normally invisible to human eyes"" — and it sounds truly fascinating."	a	1	2	2
36	143	However, despite fans being eager for the upcoming release, it seems we all need to sit tight as it won't be dropping on our screens until 2021.	a	1	2	3
37	144	But we're sure it'll be worth the wait.	a	2	1	1
38	145	Earlier this month, David was presented with the TV Choice Lifetime Achievement Award, at the prestigious ceremony in London.	a	2	1	1
39	146	The national treasure has entertained millions over his career, which has so far spanned 60 years.	a	1	3	2
40	147	"When collecting his gong, the reporter enthused: ""Indeed."	a	1	3	2
41	148	What I do isn't always entertaining, and sometimes people hear things they don't like!”	a	1	3	2
42	149	But this is an honour and a great pleasure.	a	1	1	1
43	150	"TV Choice said of the winner: ""Still working, learning and making programmes Sir David Attenborough isn't just a British hero, he's a global icon."""	a	1	3	2
44	151	This week, David was celebrated once again as a polar research ship was named after him.	a	1	2	3
45	152	The star joined both Prince William and Kate for the naming ceremony in Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead, Merseyside.	a	2	3	1
46	153	"He said: ""It's no news to any of you that the world is facing great, great problems and the most aware of that are the young people of today, who will inherit this world.”"	a	1	3	2
47	154	Great problems require great research and facts in order to solve them.”	a	1	2	3
48	155	"That's what this astonishing ship will be here to do, to find out the facts and find the science with which to deal with problems that are facing the world today and will increasingly do so tomorrow."""	a	1	3	2
49	156	Life In Colour is expected to air on BBC Two in 2021, while it's said Netflix will retain global rights.	a	1	2	2
50	412	Don't use my wife's name to score points, says husband of murdered MP Jo Cox	b	1	3	2
51	413	The husband of Jo Cox said his wife's name must not be used to score political points after Jeremy Corbyn last night posted footage of the murdered MP to criticise Boris Johnson.	b	1	2	2
52	414	"The Labour leader's film featured clips of Mrs Cox and a vigil held after her death, with the caption: ""Boris Johnson does not care about violence on our streets."""	b	1	3	2
53	415	"Critics said Mr Corbyn was using her murder to score ""cheap political points"" while her husband Brendan Cox said the Labour leader was ""wrong"" to infer hateful language was a ""simple party political issue."""	b	1	3	2
54	416	"Mr Cox said: ""Jeremy is right that the best way to honour Jo is to defeat hatred and division."	b	1	2	3
55	417	He's also right the PM has a particular responsibility.	b	3	1	2
56	418	But he's wrong to infer this is a simple party political issue.	b	1	2	3
57	419	Jo was passionately Labour but some things must transcend party politics.	b	1	2	2
58	420	"He also shared a post which said Jo Cox's name was ""more than a political scoring point"" with the caption ""This. Thank you."""	b	1	2	2
59	421	Mr Corbyn was facing a backlash for his video which opens with him talking about Mrs Cox's murder three years ago by a far-Right activist in her West Yorkshire constituency.	b	1	3	2
60	422	"Speaking over a montage of clips of Mrs Cox, Mr Johnson and female MPs, Mr Corbyn said: ""This Prime Minister knows these words can promote violence and have real consequences."	b	1	2	2
61	423	He wants division.	b	1	1	1
62	424	"Clearly, he doesn't care about the violence on our streets."""	b	1	2	2
63	425	He goes on to criticise Mr Johnson and call for a Labour government.	b	1	2	2
64	426	"Mr Corbyn added: ""Many are deeply concerned about the language used by Boris Johnson, language which is being repeated by the far-Right."	b	1	3	2
65	427	When this was raised with him by women MPs, who themselves face death threats, he arrogantly dismissed them.	b	1	2	3
66	428	"It was nothing short of disgraceful."""	b	1	1	1
67	429	"Former Labour MP John Woodcock shared the video and said: ""You can really shut up. Disgusting."""	b	1	2	3
68	430	"Meanwhile Tory MP and business minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""You are so wrong to use Jo Cox in this way, when her family have specifically asked for her not to be used in this way."	b	1	2	3
69	431	To be kept out of politics.	b	1	2	2
70	432	If you have an ounce of decency Jeremy Corbyn you would take this video down.	b	1	3	2
71	433	"It follows a row over language in Parliament this week in which Mr Johnson said that the ""best way"" to honour Mrs Cox was to ""get Brexit done."""	b	1	3	2
72	434	"Her sister Kim Leadbeater called for a dialling down of extreme language saying it was ""not helpful to Jo's kids."""	b	1	2	3
73	435	"She told ITV: ""For me to come out and say outrageous things about Boris Johnson - I just don't think that's a useful way of moving forward."	b	1	3	2
74	436	"I can say what I think is right and what I think is wrong but I'm going to try and do that in a measured manner."""	b	1	2	1

76	157	Ukraine scandal: Pelosi says Barr 'rogue'; former U.S. officials back investigation	a	1	3	2
77	158	"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused U.S. Attorney General William Barr Friday of going ""rogue"" to protect President Donald Trump over his controversial phone call with Ukraine's leader, which has led to an impeachment inquiry."	a	1	2	3
78	159	The California Democrat's words follow a release of the complaint Thursday, which was submitted by an unidentified intelligence official to Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson.	a	1	2	3
79	160	Atkinson turned it over to national intelligence director Joseph Maguire.	a	1	2	3
80	161	Barr is mentioned several times in the July 25 phone call, as is Trump attorney Rudolph Giuliani.	a	1	2	3
81	162	"The complaint says White House officials were concerned enough that they attempted to ""lock down"" the record of the call."	a	1	2	2
82	163	[Barr has] gone rogue, Pelosi told MSNBC Friday.	a	1	2	3
83	164	I think where they're going is a cover-up of a cover-up.	a	1	2	3
84	165	I think it's sad, to have a Justice Department go so rogue.	a	1	2	2
85	166	Well, they have been for a while. And now it just makes matters worse.	a	1	3	2
86	167	Pelosi announced an official impeachment investigation this week after Trump acknowledged he'd withheld military aid to Ukraine.	a	3	2	1
87	168	The aid was ultimately granted, but House Democrats want to know whether there was any connection to the aid and Trump's asking Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company for five years.	a	1	2	3
88	169	Also Friday, nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and national security officials signed a letter supporting the impeachment investigation.	a	3	2	1
89	170	"The coalition said Trump's actions constitute a ""profound national security concern."""	a	2	1	2
90	171	We applaud those members of Congress, including Speaker Pelosi, who have started us down that necessary path, the letter states.	a	1	2	2
91	172	President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic process.	a	2	1	1
92	173	That would constitute an unconscionable abuse of power.”	a	1	2	2
93	174	It would also represent an effort to subordinate America's national interests — and those of our closest allies and partners — to the president's personal political interest.	a	1	2	2
94	175	Trump has denied there was any impropriety with the phone call.	a	1	3	2
95	176	"Friday, he denounced the complainant and again said the call with Zelensky was a ""perfect conversation."""	a	3	2	1
96	177	Sounding more and more like the so-called whistle-blower isn't a whistle-blower at all, he tweeted.	a	1	3	2
97	178	In addition, all second-hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her?	a	1	3	2
98	179	A partisan operative?	a	1	3	2
99	180	Vice President Mike Pence also had interactions with Ukrainian leaders, the whistle-blower complaint shows, and he met with Zelensky in Poland earlier this month.	a	1	2	2
100	181	He said neither Joe Biden or Hunter Biden were discussed.	a	1	2	2
