0	Man set alight on doorstep 'in targeted attack'	a	1	3	2
1	A man has been set alight on his doorstep in what police believe is a targeted attack.	a	1	2	3
2	The 48-year-old was soaked in flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, before bursting into flames outside his home in Skelmersdale, West Lancashire.	a	1	1	1
3	He is in hospital in a critical but stable condition after suffering serious burns.	a	1	1	1
4	Police have launched an attempted murder inquiry after they were called to the man's house at about 1am on Thursday.	a	1	1	2
5	"Detective Chief Inspector Pauline Stables, leading the investigation, said: ""This is a horrific incident which has left a man in a very poorly condition in hospital."	a	1	1	2
6	We are carrying out a number of enquiries to try to identify those responsible.”	a	1	2	2
7	While we are trying to establish a motive for what has happened, we do believe that the incident was targeted and I would like to stress that I don't believe there is any threat to the wider community at this time.”	a	1	3	2
8	Someone out there knows who has done this and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us.”	a	1	3	2
9	Has a loved one come home acting suspiciously, smelling of smoke or petrol or with unexplained injuries?”	a	1	1	2
10	We need to find the people responsible for this dreadful crime.	a	1	1	1
11	US deaths could result in Scottish ban on vaping and e-cigarette ads	b	1	3	2
12	A BAN on advertising for e-cigarettes and vaping products, is being considered by ministers.	b	1	2	1
13	"The First Minister has confirmed that a consultation on the move would take place in ""the coming months."""	b	1	3	2
14	"Nicola Sturgeon says that if evidence supports further moves over the sale of such products her Government would ""not hesitate"" to act."	b	1	3	2
15	It comes as it emerged a vaping-related illness had claimed two more lives, bringing the total number of fatalities to 11.	b	1	3	2
16	Vaping - which involves inhaling a mix typically made of nicotine, water, solvents and flavours - is seen as an alternative to smoking which can help you quit, but its safety is still not entirely known.	b	1	2	1
17	But in the US, more than 500 people are known to have fallen ill with a mysterious lung disease after smoking e-cigarettes.	b	1	2	1
18	Officials said hundreds of additional cases had been reported in the past week alone.	b	1	1	1
19	The first deaths in Florida and Georgia were announced on Tuesday and Wednesday.	b	1	1	2
20	Currently 38 states have recorded cases of the illness, with lives lost in eight states.	b	1	2	1
21	"While most patients have reported a history of using products containing THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, the patient who died in Georgia on Wednesday reported only ""heavy nicotine vaping."""	b	1	2	2
22	"The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has more than 100 officials investigating the cause of the mystery illness, and has warned citizens against smoking e-cigarette products until more is known, particularly if modified or bought ""off the street."""	b	1	3	2
23	"The First Minister has confirmed the Scottish Government was monitorigin developments in the US and elsewhere ""closely,"" following the loss of life that has been attributed to vaping."	b	1	3	2
24	She pointed out that to date they have not seen any cases of deaths attributed to vaping being reported in Europe.	b	1	2	1
25	Our approach has been a precautionary one, which is why in Scotland we have already taken the strictest regulatory approach in Europe to vapour products, she said.	b	1	2	1
26	The European tobacco products directive restricts the advertising of e-cigarettes and ensures that e-liquids cannot contain ingredients that are known to be harmful.	b	1	1	2
27	The directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in e-liquids.	b	1	2	1
28	In Scotland, we have also introduced a retail register and a mandatory age verification scheme and we have funded trading standards departments in all council areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations.	b	2	3	1
29	"In the coming months, we will consult on introducing a complete ban on the advertising and promotion of vapour products."""	b	1	2	1
30	"She added: ""It is important to stress, and for all of us to remember, that those devices are relatively new and, therefore, their impact continues to be studied."	b	1	2	2
31	We do not yet fully understand what that impact is, which is why the approach that we have taken has been very cautious.	b	1	2	1
32	That is perhaps a reason why e-cigarette use remains relatively low in Scotland.	b	1	2	2
33	We remain committed to following the best evidence to take any steps necessary to ensure that people are protected from potential harm.	b	1	2	2
34	While we already have among the strictest regimes on those products, if the evidence shows that further action is needed... we will not hesitate to take it.	b	1	3	2
35	The Next Big Labor Strike Hits Oregon	a	1	2	1
36	The state university workers’ most pressing complaints center on low wages and a lack of dignity at work.	a	1	1	2
37	The pay disparities alone are shocking. 	a	1	1	1
38	About half of these workers earn less than $40,000 per year (and hundreds make less than $25,000). 	a	1	2	1
39	Meanwhile, university presidents' annual salaries average out to $500,000 and four university athletics coaches are pulling down a cool $1 million.	a	1	2	3
40	While school administrators enjoy six-figure salaries and overall administrative spending continues to bloat, one in six classified staffers qualify for food stamps.	a	1	2	2
41	"As Alejandro Segurra, another IT worker at Portland State University, said, ""I'm willing to go on strike because I don't think it's fair that people are paid wages that don't allow them to live in the city that they serve."" "	a	1	1	2
42	"Portland State library worker Theresa Stapleburg was even more direct: ""I want to strike because I've been here 24 years, and I need a raise — a living wage."""	a	1	1	2
43	As inflation climbs and the cost of living in Oregon soars, these workers are being left to flounder, and management has shown little sympathy for their plight.	a	1	2	1
44	Contract negotiations that began in February broke down in mid-August. 	a	1	1	1
45	At that point, the bosses had laid out some particularly egregious proposals — a paltry cost-of-living increase, a denial of seniority demands from long-term university workers, and a price hike for staff meals — that workers saw as disrespectful, and even cruel.	a	1	1	2
46	There is an unwritten class system at the universities, Fulmer said. 	a	1	2	2
47	And we are at the bottom of it.	a	1	1	1
48	Education workers have been under attack for decades, he continued.	a	1	1	1
49	We are finally standing up and fighting back.	a	1	1	1
50	It's one thing to see classism and the squeezing of the middle class in the corporate world as executives see their relatively obscene pay continue to go up at rates above inflation. 	a	1	3	2
51	But for the same thing to be happening in education is not something workers will continue to tolerate.	a	1	1	1
52	And Oregon's state university workers aren't the only ones taking action.	a	1	2	2
53	Oregon is a powder keg of militancy right now, and its fuse is now burning bright and hot.	a	1	3	2
54	Grocery store workers at the Fred Meyer supermarket chain are ramping up their campaign against their employer, and while there are no official plans to strike yet, tensions are running high; their union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, has already called for a boycott, and filed an unfair labor practice report against the chain.	a	1	1	1
55	In the healthcare sector, the 4,500 members of the Service Employees International Union Local 49 workers at Kaiser Permanente authorized a strike (with a 98 percent approval rate) if a deal isn't reached before their existing contract expires in October - which was only narrowly avoided with a new tentative agreement. 	a	1	2	1
56	Elsewhere in the industry, the Oregon Nurses Association, which represents more than 120 nurses at Astoria Hospital, has been deadlocked in contract negotiations with the hospital administration; their last contract expired in May, and the clock is ticking.	a	1	2	3
57	Oregon has a really strong labor movement that is really building from the ground up, Burley explains. 	a	1	3	2
58	This is a part of the national wave of labor growth. 	a	1	2	2
59	People are seeing a precarious economy where real wages are falling and the solution is collective action in the workplace.	a	1	3	2
60	It's unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall, but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the Northwest in 2019. 	a	1	2	2
61	And from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further, into the heart of Midwestern farming, Southern manufacturing, Texan oil fields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeastern construction, the Silicon Valley tech giants, and everywhere in between. 	a	1	1	2
62	Lord knows that something's gotta give.	a	1	2	2
63	School strikers around the world march to demand action on climate	b	1	1	1
64	Children around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change Friday, in their first major action since the issue topped world leader's agenda at the United Nations this week.	b	1	1	2
65	The Fridays for Future movement that began as a lone demonstration by Swedish teen Greta Thunbergjust over a year ago has mushroomed, with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like New Yorkand attracting attention in developing nations across Africa.	b	1	3	2
66	Some of the first protests began in New Zealand, where Thunberg saidorganizers estimated 170,000 people marched across the country.	b	2	3	1
67	There were also marches in cities in Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India, among other countries.	b	1	1	1
68	Friday's protest followed a week of climate talks at the United Nations in New York, which included a scathing speech by Thunbergto world leaders reprimanding them for inaction.	b	1	2	3
69	You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, she said on Tuesday.	b	1	2	1
70	The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.	b	1	2	1
71	Citing a U.N.-backed reportreleased last year, demonstrators are demanding governments implement measures to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees, which scientists warn result in dire consequences for human life and the planet.	b	1	2	1
72	Thunberg and the young people she has inspired say they will not stop their weekly classroom walkouts until they see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.	b	1	2	3
73	In Nigeria's capital Abuja, Oladosu Adenike marked her 46th consecutive strike on Friday.	b	1	2	1
74	"The activist posted images on Twitter of students dressed in blue school uniforms carrying banners with messages, ""Climate change is real"" and ""We don't have time."""	b	1	2	1
75	In Lausanne, Switzerland, where hundreds of climate strike organizers gatheredin August planning for this week's events, thousands of people marched through the city, according to local reports.	b	1	2	1
76	Thousands more were expected to take to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, where local media reportedthat the city's school would allow students to participate.	b	1	1	1
77	Thunberg, who remains in North America following her visit to the U.N., was scheduled to participate in climate strikes in Montreal, Canada.	b	1	1	1
78	Meghan to “fulfil her heart's desires” and refuses let own needs “fade away” amid her royal duties	a	1	3	2
79	Meghan Markle is determined to “fulfil her heart's desires” and not let her own needs “fade away” now she's a member of the Royal Family — and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls.	a	1	1	2
80	The Duchess of Sussex, 38, reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry.	a	1	1	1
81	Woodstock Exchange, the UK-SA Tech Hub, focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs, particularly women, to acquire skills, resources and support.	a	1	2	2
82	The Ladies Who Launch meeting saw the former actress, 38, meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology, conservation and fashion and praise them for “empowering the next generation” of creative minds.	a	1	2	1
83	During a conversation with the female tech founders Meghan, who has campaigned vigorously for the empowerment of young women and girls, said she hopes to do the same for young men.	a	1	2	3
84	Mother-of-two Naadiya Moosajee, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur and co-founder of Women in Engineering, revealed: “We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys — that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well,” People reports.	a	1	3	2
85	“We both have sons, and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons, but generally in public too.”	a	1	3	2
86	She added that having Meghan present “didn't feel hierarchical”, as it was “women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have, as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies”.	a	1	3	2
87	Matsi Modise, founder of skills training company Simodisa, said Meghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the Fold.	a	1	3	2
88	“She talked about being a mother and having duties as a duchess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can't just fade away now that you're a duchess,” Modise recalled.	a	1	2	3
89	“That you have to be true to who you are.”	a	1	2	1
90	She said the duchess pushed them to plough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward, knowing they are doing it for others who will follow.	a	1	3	2
91	"“She wasn't referring to being a royal, but life in general when you have challenges,” Modise added, admitting she felt a bit “awestruck"" by Meghan."	a	1	2	3
92	“She radiates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace,” Modise said.	a	1	3	2
93	“A lot of us have done amazing things as founders, but meeting a royal is quite daunting.	a	1	2	1
94	She made it easy.	a	1	3	2
95	She is an easy-going royal.”	a	1	2	1
96	Meghan also revealed she's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother, admitting she finds juggling being a royal and looking after baby Archie “a lot” but “all so exciting”.	a	1	2	3
97	"Speaking to mother-of-two Lara Rosmarin, CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology, Meghan said: ""We're only five months in right now."	a	1	2	1
98	Being a working mum and travelling as well with a baby, my goodness it's a lot, but it's all so exciting.”	a	1	2	1
99	"“There are days when it's a lot to juggle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say ""ah-ha,"" and it's so rewarding.”"	a	1	3	2
100	Meghan then went to the city's Mothers2Mothers organisation, which trains and employs women with HIV.	a	1	2	3
101	She took along some of Archie's baby clothes, including a onesie saying “The Future” and his Invictus babygro which he no longer fits, alongside donations from her friends with children.	a	1	2	3
