0	The Next Big Labor Strike Hits Oregon	origin	3	2	1
1	"The state university workers"" most pressing complaints center on low wages and a lack of dignity at work."	origin	1	1	3
2	The pay disparities alone are shocking. 	origin	1	2	3
3	About half of these workers earn less than $40,000 per year (and hundreds make less than $25,000). 	origin	1	1	2
4	"Meanwhile, university presidents"" annual salaries average out to $500,000 and four university athletics coaches are pulling down a cool $1 million. "	origin	3	1	2
5	While school administrators enjoy six-figure salaries and overall administrative spending continues to bloat, one in six classified staffers qualify for food stamps.	origin	1	1	2
6	"As Alejandro Segurra, another IT worker at Portland State University, said, ""I'm willing to go on strike because I don't think it's fair that people are paid wages that don't allow them to live in the city that they serve."""	origin	3	1	2
7	"Portland State library worker Theresa Stapleburg was even more direct: ""I want to strike because I've been here 24 years, and I need a raise - a living wage."""	origin	1	3	2
8	As inflation climbs and the cost of living in Oregon soars, these workers are being left to flounder, and management has shown little sympathy for their plight. 	origin	1	3	2
9	Contract negotiations that began in February broke down in mid-August. 	origin	1	1	1
10	At that point, the bosses had laid out some particularly egregious proposals - a paltry cost-of-living increase, a denial of seniority demands from long-term university workers, and a price hike for staff meals - that workers saw as disrespectful, and even cruel.	origin	1	1	1
11	There is an unwritten class system at the universities, Fulmer said. 	origin	1	2	2
12	And we are at the bottom of it.	origin	1	2	2
13	Education workers have been under attack for decades, he continued. 	origin	2	1	1
14	We are finally standing up and fighting back.	origin	2	1	1
15	It's one thing to see classism and the squeezing of the middle class in the corporate world as executives see their relatively obscene pay continue to go up at rates above inflation. 	origin	1	2	3
16	But for the same thing to be happening in education is not something workers will continue to tolerate.	origin	1	2	2
17	And Oregon's state university workers aren't the only ones taking action.	origin	1	1	2
18	Oregon is a powder keg of militancy right now, and its fuse is now burning bright and hot.	origin	1	2	1
19	Grocery store workers at the Fred Meyer supermarket chain are ramping up their campaign against their employer, and while there are no official plans to strike yet, tensions are running high; their union, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, has already called for a boycott, and filed an unfair labor practice report against the chain.	origin	1	2	3
20	In the healthcare sector, the 4,500 members of the Service Employees International Union Local 49 workers at Kaiser Permanente authorized a strike (with a 98 percent approval rate) if a deal isn't reached before their existing contract expires in October - which was only narrowly avoided with a new tentative agreement. 	origin	1	3	2
21	Elsewhere in the industry, the Oregon Nurses Association, which represents more than 120 nurses at Astoria Hospital, has been deadlocked in contract negotiations with the hospital administration; their last contract expired in May, and the clock is ticking.	origin	2	1	2
22	Oregon has a really strong labor movement that is really building from the ground up, Burley explains. 	origin	1	2	2
23	This is a part of the national wave of labor growth. 	origin	2	1	1
24	People are seeing a precarious economy where real wages are falling and the solution is collective action in the workplace.	origin	1	2	2
25	It's unclear just how deeply such collective action may take root this fall, but it certainly would be fitting if the general strike returned to the Northwest in 2019. 	origin	1	2	2
26	And from there we can only hope that its spirit will spread even further, into the heart of Midwestern farming, Southern manufacturing, Texan oil fields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeastern construction, the Silicon Valley tech giants, and everywhere in between. 	origin	1	2	2
27	Lord knows that something's gotta give.	origin	2	1	1
28	School strikers around the world march to demand action on climate	origin	2	1	1
29	Children around the world launched another wave of school strikes demanding action on climate change Friday, in their first major action since the issue topped world leader's agenda at the United Nations this week.	origin	1	3	2
30	The Fridays for Future movement that began as a lone demonstration by Swedish teen Greta Thunbergjust over a year ago has mushroomed, with millions of students taking to the streets of cities like New Yorkand attracting attention in developing nations across Africa.	origin	1	2	3
31	Some of the first protests began in New Zealand, where Thunberg saidorganizers estimated 170,000 people marched across the country.	origin	3	2	1
32	There were also marches in cities in Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India, among other countries.	origin	1	1	1
33	Friday's protest followed a week of climate talks at the United Nations in New York, which included a scathing speech by Thunbergto world leaders reprimanding them for inaction.	origin	1	2	3
34	You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, she said on Tuesday.	origin	3	2	1
35	The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.	origin	2	3	1
36	Citing a U.N.-backed reportreleased last year, demonstrators are demanding governments implement measures to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees, which scientists warn result in dire consequences for human life and the planet.	origin	1	2	2
37	Thunberg and the young people she has inspired say they will not stop their weekly classroom walkouts until they see a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change.	origin	1	1	1
38	In Nigeria's capital Abuja, Oladosu Adenike marked her 46th consecutive strike on Friday.	origin	2	3	1
39	"The activist posted images on Twitter of students dressed in blue school uniforms carrying banners with messages, ""Climate change is real"" and ""We don't have time."""	origin	2	1	3
40	In Lausanne, Switzerland, where hundreds of climate strike organizers gatheredin August planning for this week's events, thousands of people marched through the city, according to local reports.	origin	1	2	2
41	Thousands more were expected to take to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, where local media reportedthat the city's school would allow students to participate.	origin	2	2	1
42	Thunberg, who remains in North America following her visit to the U.N., was scheduled to participate in climate strikes in Montreal, Canada.	origin	1	1	1

44	Meghan Markle is determined to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and not let her own needs 'fade away' now she's a member of the Royal Family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls.	origin	1	2	3
45	The Duchess of Sussex, 38, reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry.	origin	1	2	3
46	Woodstock Exchange, the UK-SA Tech Hub, focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs, particularly women, to acquire skills, resources and support.	origin	1	1	1
47	The Ladies Who Launch meeting saw the former actress, 38, meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology, conservation and fashion and praise them for 'empowering the next generation' of creative minds.	origin	1	2	2

49	Mother-of-two Naadiya Moosajee, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur and co-founder of Women in Engineering, revealed: 'We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well,' People reports.	origin	1	3	2
50	'We both have sons, and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons, but generally in public too.'	origin	1	2	1
51	She added that having Meghan present 'didn't feel hierarchical', as it was 'women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have, as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies'.	origin	1	2	1
52	Matsi Modise, founder of skills training company Simodisa, said Meghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the Fold.	origin	2	1	1
53	'She talked about being a mother and having duties as a duchess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can't just fade away now that you're a duchess,' Modise recalled.	origin	1	3	2
54	'That you have to be true to who you are.'	origin	1	2	3
55	She said the duchess pushed them to plough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward, knowing they are doing it for others who will follow.	origin	3	2	1
56	'She wasn't referring to being a royal, but life in general when you have challenges,' Modise added, admitting she felt a bit 'awestruck' by Meghan.	origin	1	2	3
57	'She radiates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace,' Modise said.	origin	2	1	3
58	A lot of us have done amazing things as founders, but meeting a royal is quite daunting.	origin	1	1	1
59	She made it easy.	origin	3	1	2
60	She is an easy-going royal.'	origin	1	2	1
61	Meghan also revealed she's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother, admitting she finds juggling being a royal and looking after baby Archie 'a lot' but 'all so exciting'.	origin	1	2	2
62	Speaking to mother-of-two Lara Rosmarin, CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology, Meghan said: 'We're only five months in right now.	origin	1	3	2
63	Being a working mum and travelling as well with a baby, my goodness it's a lot, but it's all so exciting.	origin	1	1	1

67	SNP could support Jeremy Corbyn as temporary PM to stop no-deal Brexit	origin	1	2	1
68	The SNP has signalled it could support installing Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street on a temporary basis to thwart a no-deal Brexit.	origin	1	3	2
69	As tensions between MPs and Downing Street deepened, Nicola Sturgeon suggested it could row in behind the Labour leader as a caretaker prime minister until a general election.	origin	1	2	3
70	Mr Corbyn called on rebel Tories and opposition MPs to back him to lead a temporary administration in August - but the move was met with resistance, particularly from the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson.	origin	3	1	2
71	Under the proposals, opposition parties would seek to oust Boris Johnson in a vote of no confidence and then form a unity government that would seek an extension to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU on 31 October.	origin	1	1	1
72	The plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time, but senior figures in the SNP are concerned that Mr Johnson could defy a law forcing him to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place before 19 October.	origin	1	1	1
73	"Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, suggested that Mr Corbyn could be brought in to secure the extension as leaving Mr Johnson in charge would be a ""terrible idea."""	origin	1	3	2
74	"Responding to a tweet suggesting installing the Labour leader or another temporary prime minister, she said: ""Agree with this."	origin	1	1	1
75	Vote of no confidence, opposition unites around someone for sole purpose of securing an extension, and then immediate general election.	origin	1	3	2
76	"Nothing is risk free but leaving Johnson in post to force through no deal - or even a bad deal - seems like a terrible idea to me."""	origin	1	3	2
77	Veteran MPs Harriet Harman and Ken Clarke have both been named as potential figures to lead a unity government but a senior SNP source insisted it had to be the Labour leader.	origin	1	2	1
78	It is increasingly clear that we will have to install a new prime minister via a vote of no confidence, so that we can request a delay to Brexit and hold an election, the source told ITV's Robert Peston.	origin	1	1	1
79	Trying to find a compromise candidate, a national unity candidate, is too complicated, especially in the time we have.	origin	1	2	1
80	Whether people like it or not, the temporary prime minister has to be Corbyn.	origin	1	1	1
81	"An SNP spokesperson said the party was committed to stopping a no-deal Brexit and removing ""this dangerous and undemocratic prime minister as soon as possible."""	origin	1	1	1
82	"The spokesperson said: ""It is now possible - if the political will is there - that parties could come together to ensure that the letter to secure an extension is not left in the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who are determined to find a way to get around the Benn Act, but is instead sent by a temporary caretaker prime minister, who would be in office only as long as is necessary to send the letter, with an election held immediately afterwards."	origin	1	2	3
83	We remain open to all options to achieve the aim of stopping a no-deal Brexit and getting rid of Boris Johnson.	origin	1	2	1
84	Even with SNP support, it would come down to a knife-edge vote for Mr Corbyn.	origin	1	3	2
85	There are 288 Tory MPs, as well as 10 Democratic Unionists, so the opposition would need some of the 34 independent MPs to come on board.	origin	1	2	1
86	"Labour argued that the plan was the ""simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal."""	origin	1	2	1
87	However the Liberal Democrats believe a temporary government led by Mr Corbyn cannot achieve the necessary support across the House, as he would need the backing of ex-Tory MPs and defectors from his own party.	origin	1	3	2
88	"Kirstene Hair, Tory MP for Angus, said: ""This report confirms what many have long suspected - SNP MPs will happily prop up Jeremy Corbyn in No10."	origin	1	3	2
89	There is no doubt that Corbyn's weak stance on indyref2 is a deciding factor for the nationalists.	origin	1	2	2
90	He has already left the door open for a re-run of the 2014 referendum if he becomes prime minister.	origin	1	2	2
91	"Only a Conservative government will stand up for those who voted No"" in what was meant to be a once in a generation event."""	origin	1	2	2
92	"Hungarian PM Orban defends his candidate for EU executive, ""has solutions in pocket"""	origin	1	2	2
93	"Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said he has several solutions ""in his pocket"" after Hungary's candidate for the European Commission was rejected."	origin	1	1	2
94	The EU transport commissioner-designate, Romanian socialist politician Rovana Plumb, and the proposed commissioner for EU enlargement, former Hungarian justice minister Laszlo Trocsanyi, were told their confirmation hearings could not go ahead because of inconsistencies in their financial statements, Reuters reported.	origin	1	1	1
95	I am convinced that [Trocsanyi] is the most suitable candidate for becoming member of the European Commission, Orban said.	origin	1	1	1
96	His sin was that he helped the government and me... to protect Hungary from migration.	origin	1	2	2
97	The move is seen as an embarrassment for Orban, who proposed Trocsanyi, and who has been in constant conflict with Brussels over his migration policy and other issues.	origin	2	1	1
